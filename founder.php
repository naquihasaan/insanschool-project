                    <p class="text-justify">When he was about 13, the young Syed Hasan met Sir Dr. Mohammad Iqbal, a great poet and reformer. This meeting had a great impact on his life, as he decided he too would dedicate himself to serve fellow humans. He was also privileged to meet Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, and many other prominent leaders of the time who were shaping the future of the subcontinent. Syed Bhai was also a close student of Dr. Zakir Hussain Khan, the 3rd President of India. </p>

                    <h5 class="text-dark ">Achievements</h5>
                    <p class="text-justify">From cleaning the blood and beds of the T.B. patients to eating with 'mehters' (Indian toilet cleaners, belonging to the untouchable class), to caring and treating mentally-retarded individuals to simply helping those in needs, Syed Bhai was always on the forefront of many social causes. After returning from America, he entirely devoted his life to others. During the 51 years of his services, he never took a penny for himself from INSAN or the numerous other projects he helped. Many have called him a modern Gandhi or Mother Theresa, testifying to the magnitude of his sacrifices. <b>He was the recipient of the Nehru Literacy Award, Padma Shri, National Integration Award, Shiksha Bharti Paruskar, Son of Soil Award, Bihar Gurav and many Lifetime honors.</b></p>
                    <p class="text-justify">He was a very humble man and maintained an extremely modest life out of the limelight. Syed Bhai was always a spiritual man. His actions and mission always reflected his deep-rooted religious beliefs, and the peaceful teachings of all religions. </p>
