INSAN Mission has been a successful paragon of unity, harmony and brotherhood. Dr. Hasan created an atmosphere where people from different backgrounds, casts, religions, regions and languages work together, learn together, live together and grow together. His efforts and his mission have had a great impact in transforming the lives of the people in the region and have brought about a metamorphosis of inspiration for all mankind everywhere.</p>
